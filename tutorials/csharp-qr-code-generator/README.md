        {
            // Initialize a new QR Code
            QrCode qrCode = QrWriter.Encode("hello world");
            
            // Obtain a Bitmap of the QR Code
            AnyBitmap qrBitmap = qrCode.ToBitmap();
            
            // Store the QR Code image to a file
            qrBitmap.SaveAs("qr.png");
        }
    }
}
```

### Easy QR Code Decoding with IronQR:

QR codes are omnipresent and typically carry crucial data. IronQR allows for straightforward QR code decoding in your C# applications. This example demonstrates how to decode a QR code from an image file. IronQR simplifies the decoding process, making it accessible for beginners and seasoned programmers alike. Simply load an image, decode its QR content, and access the embedded data easily. Explore the ease of use IronQR offers and enhance your software projects with efficient QR code decoding capabilities.

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using IronQR;
namespace ironqr.CsharpQrCodeGenerator
{
    public class Section2
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // Read an image file to decode QR Codes from
            var imageToDecode = AnyBitmap.FromFile("IMAGE_TO_READ.png");
            
            // Prepare the image for QR decoding
            QrImageInput qrInput = new QrImageInput(imageToDecode);
            
            // Instantiate a new QR Code reader
            QrReader qrReader = new QrReader();
            
            // Decode and retrieve all QR Codes from the input
            IEnumerable<QrResult> qrResults = qrReader.Decode(qrInput);
        }
    }
}
```
