</div>

The process begins with the integration of essential namespaces: `IronQr` and `IronSoftware.Drawing`. A special focus is placed on the `Color` class from the `IronSoftware.Drawing` namespace, which is crucial for managing image alterations.

Before initiating the QR code reading, it's crucial to activate the IronQR software by setting your license key through `IronQr.License.LicenseKey`. Following this, the QR code image file is loaded using `AnyBitmap.FromFile("QRCode.png")`.

Once the image is loaded, it is then prepped for QR code detection. This is achieved by constructing a `QrImageInput` object that encapsulates the image, preparing it for further processing.

The primary functionality is driven by the `QrReader` class, which is created and tasked with executing the QR code reading. This class processes the prepared image (`qrInput`), scanning for any embedded QR codes. The outcome of this operation yields a series of `QrResult` objects, each corresponding to a QR code detected in the image.

To interact with and extract information from the QR codes, the program iterates through the `QrResult` collection in a `foreach` loop. Each `QrResult` instance encapsulates attributes such as the QR code's content, allowing for retrieval and display of the encoded data.

### Flexible QR Code Reading Options

IronQR offers multiple reading modes for QR codes, each optimized for specific scanning needs. This versatility ensures that users can efficiently handle various scanning cases.

Mixed Scan Mode provides a balanced approach between speed and precision. It’s particularly useful when the QR codes are partly obscured or not clearly visible, ensuring reliable readings without sacrificing performance.

The Machine Learning (ML) Scan Mode utilizes advanced algorithms to interpret QR codes that are worn out or difficult to decode under normal conditions. This mode is invaluable for challenging scenarios where traditional methods fall short.

For straightforward and clean QR codes, the Basic Scan Mode offers the fastest scanning solution. It simplifies the reading process, ideal for quick scans where the QR codes are excellent and uncomplicated.

```cs
using IronQr;
using IronQr.Enum;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Set the license key for IronQR.
IronQr.License.LicenseKey = "License-Key";

// Load the QR Code image from a file.
var imageFile = AnyBitmap.FromFile("QRCode.png");

// Prepare an image input for Mixed Scan Mode, optimized for detecting QR codes.
QrImageInput mixedScanInput = new QrImageInput(imageFile, QrScanMode.OnlyDetectionModel);
IEnumerable<QrResult> mixedScanResults = new QrReader().Read(mixedScanInput);

// Configure an input for Machine Learning Scan Mode, ideal for reading poorly visible QR codes.
QrImageInput mlScanInput = new QrImageInput(imageFile, QrScanMode.OnlyDetectionModel);
IEnumerable<QrResult> mlScanResults = new QrReader().Read(mlScanInput);

// Set up Basic Scan Mode for fast scanning of straightforward, clear QR codes.
QrImageInput basicScanInput = new QrImageInput(imageFile, QrScanMode.OnlyBasicScan);

## Step 4: Develop Backend Logic

### 4.1 Initialization and Setup

Initially, the application begins by incorporating necessary namespaces: `IronQr` and `IronSoftware.Drawing`. These are crucial as they bring the required functionalities to generate and modify QR codes and manage color settings within the application. The custom Color class is particularly tailored to meet the specifications needed by IronQR.

```cs
using IronQr;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using Color = IronSoftware.Drawing.Color;
```

In the QR_Generator class’s constructor, crucial initial setup is undertaken which includes setting up the form’s user interface components.

```cs
public QR_Generator()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    ApplyLicenseKey();
    ConfirmDirectoryExists(qrCodesPath);
}
```

**ApplyLicenseKey**: A necessary method where the IronQR library license key is set, enabling the full capabilities of the software for commercial use.

**ConfirmDirectoryExists**: Verifies the existence of a specific directory at launch. If absent, it creates it ensuring there’s a location ready for QR code storage.

### 4.2 Applying the License Key

```cs
private static void ApplyLicenseKey()
{
    IronQr.License.LicenseKey = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY";
}
```

Set the license key for the IronQR library promptly as the application starts to allow all its functionalities to be unlocked and used without restrictions.

### 4.3 Directory Management

Manage the directory for saving QR codes efficiently to ensure it exists and is accessible:

```cs
private static void ConfirmDirectoryExists(string path)
{
    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(path))
    {
        System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(path);
    }
}
```

This method checks and creates the necessary directory if it does not exist using the System.IO namespace functionalities.

The directory path, `qrCodesPath`, specifies where the QR codes will be stored, incorporating the application's startup directory.

```cs
string qrCodesPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "QR Codes");
```

### 4.4 Handling Color Selection

Facilitate users in choosing colors for QR codes, ensuring the input is incorporated into the QR code design:

```cs
private void UpdateColor(ref Color targetColor, Control display, bool isBackground)
{
    if (select_color.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        var hexColor = ColorToHex(select_color.Color);
        targetColor = new Color(hexColor);
        display.BackColor = select_color.Color;
    }
}
```

This process allows for a user-friendly method to pick and apply colors directly affecting the QR code's appearance, handled by dialogs and UI updates.

### 4.5 Adding a Logo

Provide functionality to include a logo, enhancing the personalization of the QR code:

```cs
private void btn_logo_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (select_logo.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        try
        {
            logoBmp = new AnyBitmap(select_logo.FileName);
            selected_logo.Image = Image.FromFile(select_logo.FileName);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ShowError("Logo loading failed", ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

This method handles image file selection and visual feedback, showing the logo immediately on the user interface.

### 4.6 Generating the QR Code

Trigger the QR code generation process effectively based on user input and selected options:

```cs
private void btn_generate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    GenerateQRCode();
}

private void GenerateQRCode()
{
    try
    {
        var options = new QrOptions(QrErrorCorrectionLevel.High);
        var myQr = QrWriter.Write(txt_QR.Text, options);
        var style = CreateStyleOptions();
        var qrImage = myQr.Save(style);
        var fileName = $"{DateTime.Now:yyyyMMddHHmmssfff}_QR.png";
        var fullPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(qrCodesPath, fileName);
        qrImage.SaveAs(fullPath);
        pictureBox.Image = Image.FromFile(fullPath);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ShowError("QR code generation or saving failed", ex.Message);
    }
}
```

This method utilizes user-defined settings like color, dimensions, and logo, synthesizing them to generate the desired QR code and saves it to the designated directory.

### 4.7 Saving the QR Code

Enable users to save generated QR codes in their preferred format and location:

```cs
private void btn_save_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    SaveQRCode();
}

private void SaveQRCode()
{
    if (pictureBox.Image == null)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("No QR code available to save.", "Error");
        return;
    }

    saveFileDialog.Filter = "PNG Files|*.png|JPEG Files|*.jpg";
    saveFileDialog.Title = "Save QR Code";
    saveFileDialog.FileName = "QRCode";

    if (saveFileDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        try
        {
            pictureBox.Image.Save(saveFileDialog.FileName, DetermineImageFormat(saveFileDialog.FileName));
            MessageBox.Show("QR Code saved successfully!", "Success");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ShowError("Failed to save QR code", ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

A simple and intuitive interface prompts the user to save the QR code, ensuring the file is secured in the desired format at the chosen location.

### 4.8 Resetting the Application

Allow users to reset the application to its initial state easily:

```cs
private void btn_reset_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ResetFields();
}

private void ResetFields()
{
    txt_QR.Text = "";
    txt_dimension.Value = 200;
    txt_margin.Value = 0;
    bgColor = Color.White;
    color = Color.Black;
    txt_selected_color.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.White;
    txt_selected_bgcolor.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Black;
    logoBmp = null;
    selected_logo.Image = null;
    pictureBox.Image = null;
}
```

This function restores all inputs and settings to their default values, preparing the application for a new task without manual adjustments.

### 4.9 Error Management

Effectively handle and display errors to the user, improving the application’s reliability and user experience:

```cs
private static void ShowError(string title, string message)
{
    MessageBox.Show($"{title}: {message}", "Error");
}
```

This method is employed throughout the application to provide clear and actionable error messages, aiding in troubleshooting and enhancing user satisfaction.

### 4.1 Setup and Initialization

The application starts by incorporating the required namespaces: `IronQr` and `IronSoftware.Drawing`. These namespaces are crucial as they equip the application with the necessary tools for creating and customizing QR codes and colors. A specialized `Color` class is established to streamline color management within the QR code creation process, replacing the standard `System.Drawing.Color` to align with IronQR's specifications.

```cs
// Necessary namespaces for QR code operations
using IronQr;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
// Alias definition for Color to avoid conflicts with System.Drawing.Color
using Color = IronSoftware.Drawing.Color;
```

The `QR_Generator` class constructor is essential in setting up the application by initializing its components. This initialization process is typical in Windows Forms applications to configure the user interface elements of the form.

Here's the paraphrased section with relative URL paths resolved to `ironsoftware.com`:

```cs
public QR_Generator()
{
    InitializeFormComponents();
    ApplyLicenseKey();
    ValidateDirectoryExists(qrCodesDirectory);
}
```

**SetLicenseKey**: This function initializes the IronQR library by applying a valid license key. Employing a license key is essential for commercial utilization and to access all the features offered by the IronQR library.

**EnsureDirectoryExists**: This function is designed to manage storage for the QR codes generated. It verifies the presence of a "QR Codes" directory at the application's startup location and creates one if it isn't already there.

### 4.2 Configuring the License Key

For IronQR to function to its full potential, it's essential to activate it with a valid license key. This activation process is facilitated through the `SetLicenseKey` method. This static function is tailored to endorse the library with either your trial or purchased license key. Below is the code sample that demonstrates how to implement the license key configuration:

```cs
private static void SetLicenseKey()
{
    IronQr.License.LicenseKey = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY";
}
```
Replace "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" with your actual license key supplied by Iron Software. This function is crucial as it ensures that the library is primed and ready, adhering to licensing agreements right when the application starts, thereby avoiding any limitations in its operation.

Here's the rewritten section ensuring that the relative URL paths from links and images resolve to `ironsoftware.com`:

```cs
// Sets the license key for IronQR
private static void InitializeLicense()
{
    IronQr.License.LicenseKey = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY";
}
```

Substitute "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" with your legitimate license key provided by Iron Software. This function is invoked within the `QR_Generator` class constructor to activate the license at the initiation of the application, prior to any QR code creation activities.

### 4.3 Managing Directories

The application employs the `EnsureDirectoryExists` method to verify the existence of the specified directory where QR codes will be stored. If the directory does not exist, it is created. This method requires a string parameter that specifies the directory path to be checked or created. Below is the implementation:

```cs
private static void EnsureDirectoryExists(string path)
{
    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(path))
    {
        System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(path);
    }
}
```

This method checks for the directory at the provided path. If the directory is not found, it creates a new directory at that location using `System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory()`.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article with resolved relative URL paths:

```cs
// Method to verify and create directory if it does not exist
private static void CheckAndCreateDirectory(string directoryPath)
{
    // Check if directory exists at the specified path
    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(directoryPath))
    {
        // Create the directory if it does not exist
        System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(directoryPath);
    }
}
```

The function interacts with the file system through the `System.IO` namespace. Initially, it verifies the presence of a directory at a given path by implementing `Directory.Exists`. If the result shows the directory is missing (returns false), it subsequently generates the directory with `Directory.CreateDirectory`.

Configured within the QR_Generator class constructor, the path variable `qrCodesDirectory` is assembled by uniting the application's startup path with the directory "QR Codes".
```

Here is the paraphrased section of the article with resolved relative URL paths:

-----
```cs
// Defines the directory to store QR codes by combining the application's startup path with a specified folder name
string qrCodesDirectory = System.IO.Path.Combine(Application.StartupPath, "QR Codes");
```

### 4.4 Choosing Colors

The user interface of the application features two distinct buttons for color customization: `btn_color_Click` to alter the QR code's foreground color, and `btn_background_Click` for modifying the background color. These buttons invoke a color dialog box that allows users to easily choose their desired colors.

After selecting a color through the dialog box, the application converts the selected color into a hexadecimal string. This conversion is essential as the IronQR library mandates that colors be specified in this hexadecimal format. The transformation is handled by the `ColorToHex` method to ensure compatibility with IronQR's requirements.

Here's your paraphrased code section:

```cs
// Converts a System.Drawing.Color to a hexadecimal color string
private string ConvertColorToHex(System.Drawing.Color color)
{
    return string.Format("#{0:X2}{1:X2}{2:X2}", color.R, color.G, color.B);
}
```

The `UpdateColor` function processes the chosen color, transforming it into the `IronSoftware.Drawing.Color` type through a hexadecimal conversion, and adjusts the QR code's foreground or background colors accordingly. It additionally refreshes the user interface to display the updated color selection:

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
private void UpdateColor(ref Color colorReference, Control control, bool isBackground)
{
    if (select_color.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        string hexValue = ColorToHex(select_color.Color);
        colorReference = new Color(hexValue);
        control.BackColor = select_color.Color;
    }
}
```

### 4.5 Integrating a Logo into QR Codes

Within the application, there is a specific button named `btn_logo_Click`. When activated, it prompts a file selection dialog where users can choose an image to serve as the logo for their QR code. This feature is especially valuable for businesses or individuals who want to incorporate their branding directly into their QR codes. Below is an outline of how this logo integration is implemented:

```cs
private void btn_logo_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (select_logo.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        try
        {
            // Load the logo image from the selected file
            logoBmp = new AnyBitmap(select_logo.FileName);
            // Display the logo in the application's interface
            selected_logo.Image = Image.FromFile(select_logo.FileName);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Display an error message if the logo fails to load
            ShowError("An error occurred while loading the logo", ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

This functionality provides a straightforward approach for users to apply their custom logos, enhancing the aesthetic and functional value of the QR codes generated.

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided C# code section with resolved URL paths:

```cs
private void btn_logo_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Open the file selection dialog to pick a logo image
    if (select_logo.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        // Attempt to load the selected image file as a logo
        try
        {
            // Load the image using the AnyBitmap class
            logoBmp = new AnyBitmap(select_logo.FileName);
            // Display the logo image in the 'selected_logo' picture box component
            selected_logo.Image = Image.FromFile(select_logo.FileName);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // If loading the logo fails, display an error message
            ShowError("Failed to load the logo image", ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

This revised version maintains the original logic but rephrases comments and error messages for clarity, enhancing readability and understanding.

Upon choosing an image successfully, the application tries to load it and show a preview. The `AnyBitmap` variable `logoBmp` is subsequently assigned the chosen image, which will be utilized by the QR code generation process later on.

### 4.6 Generating QR Codes

The QR code creation starts once the "Generate" button is selected, activating the `btn_generate_Click` method. This function serves as the catalyst that initiates the `GenerateQRCode` function, where the core logic for QR code generation is executed.

```cs
private void btn_generate_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    GenerateQRCode();  // Initiates the QR code generation process
}
```

Within the `GenerateQRCode` method, the application constructs a QR code adhering to the provided parameters such as the input text and various styling preferences. This method is responsible for assembling a QR code by utilizing the chosen colors, size specifications, border margins, and, if provided, a logo.

```cs
private void GenerateQRCode()
{
    try
    {
        // Define the error correction level for the QR code
        var qrSettings = new QrOptions(QrErrorCorrectionLevel.High);
        // Generate the QR Code with the input text
        var createdQr = QrWriter.Write(txt_QR.Text, qrSettings);
        // Apply style settings defined by the user
        var styleConfig = CreateStyleOptions();
        // Save the styled QR code as an image
        var generatedQrImage = createdQr.Save(styleConfig);
        // Generate a unique filename based on the current timestamp
        var generatedFileName = $"{DateTime.Now:yyyyMMddHHmmssfff}_QR.png";
        // Create the full path for saving the image
        var fullPathToFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(qrCodesDirectory, generatedFileName);
        // Save the QR code image to the specified location
        generatedQrImage.SaveAs(fullPathToFile);
        // Display the saved QR code on the application's PictureBox
        pictureBox.Image = Image.FromFile(fullPathToFile);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Display an error message if something goes wrong during the QR code generation or saving process
        ShowError("An issue occurred while generating or saving the QR code", ex.Message);
    }
}
```

The `QrOptions` object specifies the level of error correction, which boosts the robustness of the QR code against potential damages or coverings. Subsequently, the `CreateStyleOptions` function constructs a `QrStyleOptions` object that encapsulates customization options specified by the user, such as colors, size, and logo. Let’s examine this function closely:

Here's the paraphrased section with absolute URLs for images and links:

```cs
private QrStyleOptions ConfigureQRStyle()
{
    return new QrStyleOptions
    {
        BackgroundColor = bgColor,
        Color = color,
        Dimensions = txt_dimension.Value > 0 ? Convert.ToInt32(txt_dimension.Value) : throw new ArgumentException("Dimensions must be set correctly!"),
        Margins = Convert.ToInt32(txt_margin.Value),
        Logo = logoBmp != null ? new QrLogo { Bitmap = logoBmp, Width = 50, Height = 50, CornerRadius = 5 } : null
    };
}
```

In this method, a `QrStyleOptions` object is constructed, enabling the QR code generation system to incorporate the user's specific preferences. Here are the customizable options:

- **BackgroundColor and Color**: These attributes are utilized to specify the QR code's background and foreground shades, offering a customizable appearance that can be aligned with branding or visual preferences.

- **Dimensions**: This attribute defines the QR code's size, providing adaptability in its application across various platforms or materials.

- **Margins**: This attribute establishes the size of the margin surrounding the QR code, which is essential to keep it distinct from adjacent elements, an important factor for enhancing scan reliability.

- **Logo**: Should the user opt to integrate a logo, this configuration allows for setting precise dimensions and a corner radius, ensuring the logo's seamless integration into the QR code for a refined appearance.

### 4.7 Saving the QR Code

When the "Save" button is engaged, it activates the `btn_save_Click` function. This function in turn invokes the `SaveQRCode` method, handling the actual saving process of the QR code. A save file dialog box is presented, offering options to select the desired file format and the save location of the QR code.

```cs
private void btn_save_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ExecuteSaveOperation();
}

private void ExecuteSaveOperation()
{
    if (pictureBox.Image == null)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("No QR code available for saving.", "Error");
        return;
    }

    saveFileDialog.Filter = "PNG Files|*.png|JPEG Files|*.jpg";
    saveFileDialog.Title = "Save the QR Code";
    saveFileDialog.FileName = "QRCode";

    if (saveFileDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        try
        {
            pictureBox.Image.Save(saveFileDialog.FileName, IdentifyImageFormat(saveFileDialog.FileName));
            MessageBox.Show("Your QR code has been successfully saved!", "Success");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ShowError("Failed to save the QR code", ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

This function verifies the presence of a generated QR code. If available, it offers options to save the QR code either as a PNG or JPEG file. The function `DetermineImageFormat` confirms that the QR code is saved in the appropriate format, depending on the file extension selected by the user.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article with the link and image paths resolved to "ironsoftware.com":

```cs
private System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat CheckImageFormat(string filePath)
{
    // Obtain the file extension and convert to lowercase
    string extension = System.IO.Path.GetExtension(filePath).ToLower();
    
    // Return JPEG format for .jpg files, otherwise return PNG format
    return extension == ".jpg" ? System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg : System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png;
}
```

This versatility empowers users to select the file format that best aligns with their preferences—opting for PNG when quality is paramount, or JPEG when minimizing file size is crucial.

### 4.8 Resetting the Application

The application includes a "Reset" feature, accessible via a "Reset" button. Engaging this button triggers the `btn_reset_Click` method. This action, in sequence, prompts the `ResetFields` function. This particular function is crafted to clear away all user entries and revert all settings to their initial defaults, such as text fields, color choices, and any logos that have been chosen.

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
private void btn_reset_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ClearAllInputs();
}

private void ClearAllInputs()
{
    txt_QR.Text = "";  // Clear the QR text field
    txt_dimension.Value = 200;  // Reset the dimension to the default value
    txt_margin.Value = 0;  // Set the margin value back to zero
    bgColor = Color.White;  // Revert the background color to white
    color = Color.Black;  // Set the QR code color to black
    txt_selected_color.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.White;  // Reset the color preview to white
    txt_selected_bgcolor.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Black;  // Reset the background color preview to black
    logoBmp = null;  // Clear the selected logo
    selected_logo.Image = null;  // Remove the image from the logo preview
    pictureBox.Image = null;  // Clear the main picture box image
}
```

This function reinitializes all settings related to QR code creation. Specifically, it erases any text meant for the QR code, reverts dimensions and margins to their original settings, and eliminates any chosen colors or logos.

### 4.9 Managing Errors

The application employs a method called `ShowError` to present error messages in an accessible and clear format. This function requires two arguments: a title and a message, which help clarify the error for the user. Below is the implementation:

Here's the paraphrased section of the provided .NET article, with enhanced code comments and slightly altered syntax for clarity:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Displays an error message in a message box.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="title">The title of the error dialog.</param>
/// <param name="message">The error message to display.</param>
private static void DisplayError(string title, string message)
{
    // Using MessageBox to display error messages to the user, formatted with title and message
    MessageBox.Show($"{title}: {message}", "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
}
```

This approach is implemented across various components of the application to guarantee that users are immediately and effectively notified of any issues in a clear and straightforward manner. For instance, if there are interruptions during the logo upload or while generating the QR code, the application invokes the `ShowError` method to provide a detailed explanation of the problem.

## Step 5: Launching the Application

Upon launching the application, the main interface is displayed as illustrated in the included image. It's methodically arranged into separate sections dedicated to input, styling, output, and operational controls. This structured layout ensures an intuitive user experience, facilitating easy navigation and interaction within the application.

<div class="content-img-align-center">
	<img src="/static-assets/qr/tutorials/csharp-qr-code-generator-application/application-output.webp" alt="Application Output"  class="img-responsive add-shadow img-margin">
</div>

The initial phase of creating the QR code is to input your information into the "Input QR Text" box. This information could be a website address or any text that you want to encode within your QR code. Following this, you can customize your QR code by choosing a logo. This is done by pressing the "Select Logo" button. Once a logo is selected, it will show up in the preview section next to the button, signifying its successful integration into your QR code's design.

After selecting the logo, we proceed to pick the colors for both the foreground and the background of the QR code. When we click the color selection buttons, the chosen colors are instantly shown in the display boxes adjacent to each button. This instant feedback confirms that our color choices have been successfully recorded.
